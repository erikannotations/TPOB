Marking Pynchon's return after vanishing for nearly two decades following his epic Gravity's Rainbow, it was initially regarded as slight, a middling curiosity. However, for Peter Coviello, the oft-overlooked Vineland opens up new ways of thinking about Pynchon's writing and about how we read and how we live in the rough currents of history. Beginning with his early besotted encounters with Vineland, Coviello reads Pynchon's offbeat novel of sixties insurgents stranded in the Reaganite summer of 1984 as a delirious stoner comedy that is simultaneously a work of heartsick fury and political grief: a portrait of the hard afterlives of failed revolution in a period of stifling reaction. Offering a roving meditation on the uses of criticism and the practice of friendship, the fashioning of publics and counterpublics, the sentence and the police, Coviello argues that Vineland is among the most abundant and far-sighted of late-century American excursions into novelistic possibility. Departing from visions of Pynchon as the arch-postmodernist, erudite and obscure, he discloses an author far more companionable and humane. In Pynchon's harmonizing of joyousness and outrage, comedy and sorrow, Coviello finds a model for thinking through our catastrophic present""--","2020","2024-03-29 21:44:42","2024-03-29 21:44:42","","","142","","","","","","Rereadings","","","","Columbia University Press","New York","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","PS3566.Y55 V56336 2020","","","","","","Criticism and interpretation; Pynchon, Thomas; Vineland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"5WEG6TYS","book","2012","Cowart, David","Thomas Pynchon and the Dark Passages of History","","978-0-8203-3709-8","","","","""Thomas Pynchon helped pioneer the postmodern aesthetic. His formidable body of work challenges readers to think and perceive in ways that anticipate - with humor, insight, and cogency - much that has emerged in the field of literary theory over the past few decades. For David Cowart, Pynchon's most profound teachings are about history - history as myth, as rhetorical construct, as false consciousness, as prologue, as mirror, and as seedbed of national and literary identities. In one encyclopedic novel after another, Pynchon has reconceptualized historical periods that he sees as culturally definitive. Examining Pynchon's entire body of work, Cowart offers an engaging, metahistorical reading of V.; an exhaustive analysis of the influence of German culture in Pynchon's early work, with particular emphasis on Gravity's Rainbow; and a critical spectroscopy of those dark stars, Mason & Dixon and Against the Day. He defends the California fictions The Crying of Lot 49, Vineland, and Inherent Vice as roman fleuve chronicling the decade in which the American tapestry began to unravel. Cowart ends his study by considering Pynchon's place in literary history. Cowart argues that Pynchon has always understood the facticity of historical narrative and the historicity of storytelling - not to mention the relations of both story and history to myth. Thomas Pynchon and the Dark Passages of History offers a deft analysis of the problems of history as engaged by our greatest living novelist and argues for the continuity of Pynchon's historical vision.""--Project Muse","2012","2024-03-29 21:44:45","2024-07-14 01:46:24","","","250","","","","","","","","","","University of Georgia Press","Athens","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 1059003979","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"95A99L4W","book","2018","","Thomas Pynchon in context","","978-1-108-49702-2","","","","""Introduction Inger H. Dalsgaard Thomas Pynchon has long had a place in the pantheon of Great American Writers. His status lies in the scope of his work - the number of publications, the prodigious detail and expansiveness of his topics - as well as the sheer quality of his writing, all of which quickly led to comparisons with Herman Melville and James Joyce. His writing is widely taught (as part of required literature survey courses at universities, for example), and remains the subject of many scholarly articles, dissertations and monographs not just in the United States and other English-speaking countries, as one might expect, but also across Europe and Asia. According to the database of publications compiled on Vheissu.net, more than 400 doctoral dissertations have been accepted and more than 100 monographs and essay collections published on his writing already, mostly in English but also in other languages such as Spanish, Italian and German, with a handful from publishers in Korea, China and Japan.

Among other factors this is due to the publication of three novels, Against the Day (2006), Inherent Vice (2009), and Bleeding Edge (2013), which have each brought something distinctively new to the table. Against the Day's vast scope and range makes it Pynchon's most fully realized example of what has come to be conceived of as the ""systems novel""; Inherent Vice's revisiting of the counterculture era first examined by Pynchon in The Crying of Lot 49 (1966) offers a concrete point of comparison on which to base assessments of his maturation as a writer amid changing socio-political contexts, and Bleeding Edge, Pynchon's (quasi-)9/11 novel, provides a thorough and long-anticipated thematic engagement with computer technology and digital culture. Mason & Dixon, published a little before the turn of the millennium in 1997 and one of Pynchon's most critically-acclaimed works, has also provided fertile ground for twenty-first century criticism""--","2019","2024-03-29 21:49:08","2024-03-29 21:49:08","","","262","","","","","","Twenty-first century critical revisions","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge, United Kingdom ; New York, NY","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","PS3566.Y55 Z735 2019","","","","","","Criticism and interpretation; Pynchon, Thomas","Freer, Joanna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Weil sie nicht an der Macht, sondern an ihrer eigenen Spaltung interessiert sind, führt jede Spur, die ein Stück des Dunkels erhellt, das die Wahrheit umgibt, Pynchons Helden nur in ein neues Dunkel. Die Beiträge, die dieser Band vereinigt, versuchen diesen Spuren in den Romanen von Thomas Pynchon nachzugehen, um damit die Produktivität von Pynchons romanesker Medienarchäologie als Schnittstelle zwischen einer historischen Medienwissenschaft und dem Archiv der Wissenschafts- und Technikgeschichte zu demonstrieren.

Dalsgaard Thomas Pynchon has long had a place in the pantheon of Great American Writers. His status lies in the scope of his work - the number of publications, the prodigious detail and expansiveness of his topics - as well as the sheer quality of his writing, all of which quickly led to comparisons with Herman Melville and James Joyce. His writing is widely taught (as part of required literature survey courses at universities, for example), and remains the subject of many scholarly articles, dissertations and monographs not just in the United States and other English-speaking countries, as one might expect, but also across Europe and Asia. According to the database of publications compiled on Vheissu.net, more than 400 doctoral dissertations have been accepted and more than 100 monographs and essay collections published on his writing already, mostly in English but also in other languages such as Spanish, Italian and German, with a handful from publishers in Korea, China and Japan. However, Pynchon is not just a canonical writer within scholarly research and teaching communities. Because of their scope and imaginative richness, his novels also have great appeal outside academia, and many devoted readers share their interest in his novels on websites dedicated to exploring his work.

Designed for students, scholars and fans alike, the Companion begins with a biography of the elusive author and ends with a coda on how to read Pynchon and a bibliography for further reading""--Provided by publisher","2012","2024-03-29 21:51:31","2024-03-29 21:51:31","","","193","","","","","","Cambridge companions to literature","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge ; New York","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","PS3566.Y55 Z5766 2012","OCLC: ocn751751613","","","","","Criticism and interpretation; Pynchon, Thomas; LITERARY CRITICISM / American / General","Dalsgaard, Inger H.; Herman, Luc; McHale, Brian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among other factors this is due to the publication of three novels, Against the Day (2006), Inherent Vice (2009), and Bleeding Edge (2013), which have each brought something distinctively new to the table. Against the Day's vast scope and range makes it Pynchon's most fully realized example of what has come to be conceived of as the ""systems novel""; Inherent Vice's revisiting of the counterculture era first examined by Pynchon in The Crying of Lot 49 (1966) offers a concrete point of comparison on which to base assessments of his maturation as a writer amid changing socio-political contexts, and Bleeding Edge, Pynchon's (quasi-) 9/11 novel, provides a thorough and long-anticipated thematic engagement with computer technology and digital culture. Mason & Dixon, published a little before the turn of the millennium in 1997 and one of Pynchon's most critically-acclaimed works, has also provided fertile ground for twenty-first century criticism""","2019","2024-03-29 21:51:31","2024-07-09 21:45:45","","","","","","","","","Twenty-first-century critical revisions","","","","Cambridge university press","Cambridge New York","eng","","","","","BnF ISBN","","","","","","","","Freer, Joanna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Doch anders als die Wahrheit der Philosophen gehört es zur Wahrheit, der diese Helden auf der Spur sind, daß es nicht Die Eine Wahrheit gibt, sondern nur eine unabsehbare Zahl von Spuren der Wahrheit. Weil sie nicht an der Macht, sondern an ihrer eigenen Spaltung interessiert sind, führt jede Spur, die ein Stück des Dunkels erhellt, das die Wahrheit umgibt, Pynchons Helden nur in ein neues Dunkel. Die Beiträge, die dieser Band vereinigt, versuchen diesen Spuren in den Romanen von Thomas Pynchon nachzugehen, um damit die Produktivität von Pynchons romanesker Medienarchäologie als Schnittstelle zwischen einer historischen Medienwissenschaft und dem Archiv der Wissenschafts- und Technikgeschichte zu demonstrieren. Diese Produktivität wird freigesetzt, wenn sich die Lektüre des Texts von der universitären Disziplinierung durch die Fiktionalitätsregel befreit und Pynchons Texte tatsächlich als faction, als Schnittstelle zwischen fact und fiction begreift","2003","2024-03-29 21:51:40","2024-07-08 19:06:26","","","136","","","","","Thomas Pynchon","('Medien) i","15","","","Verl. und Datenbank für Geisteswissenschaften","Weimar","ger","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/MIYS4I5Z/Siegert et al. - 2003 - Thomas Pynchon Archiv - Verschwörung - Geschichte.pdf","","","","Siegert, Bernhard; Krajewski, Markus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Doody both uses and resists an impressively eclectic mix of literary critical strategies to examine a host of novels from the Continental, English, and American traditions, demonstrating that the novel, with its limitless possibilities, eludes any single theory that tries to encapsulate it."" ""In the course of his discussion, Doody covers works by Cervantes, Austen, Dickens, James, Conrad, Forster, Joyce, Eliot, Woolf, Kafka, Hemingway, Beckett, Bely, Borges, Nabokov, Bellow, Robbe-Grillet, Barthes, Derrida, Pynchon, Garcia Marquez, Updike, Rushdie, and Morrison. In every case the novel comes first, he argues, because more than just another literary type, it is a vision of human experience without which our modern world would be inexplicable. Every serious reader ""feels"" his life contains a novel; no theory can evoke that response.""--Jacket","1998","2024-03-29 21:59:47","2024-04-26 19:44:28","","92-145","","","","","","","","","","","Louisiana State University Press","Baton Rouge","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 47010100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4IXCT9ST","bookSection","2000","Elsaesser, Thomas","","Weimar cinema and after: Germany's historical imaginary","978-0-203-38833-4","","","","German cinema of the 1920s is still regarded as one of the 'golden ages' of world cinema. Films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, Nosferatu, Metropolis, Pandora's Box and The Blue Angel have long been canonised as classics, but they are also among the key films defining Germany as a nation uneasy with itself. The work of directors like Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau and G.W. Pabst - having apparently announced the horrors of fascism, while testifying to the traumas of a defeated nation - still casts a long shadow over cinema in Germany, leaving film history and political history curiously intertwined. Weimar cinema and after: Germany's historical imaginary offers a fresh perspective on this most 'national' of national cinemas, re-evaluating such labels as 'Expressionist film' and 'The new Sobriety' and even putting 'fascinating fascism' and film noir in a different, international context. Thomas Elsaesser questions the conventional readings which link these genres and movements solely to the legacy of German romanticism and nationalism, and offers new approaches to analysing the function of national cinema in an advanced 'culture industry'. Elsaesser reads the major films as well as popular entertainment cinema against the contradictory background of avant-garde modernity and consumerist modernisation from the 1920s to the late 1930s. He argues that Weimar cinema's significance lay less in its ability either to promote socialism or predict fascism than in its contribution to the creation of a community sharing a 'historical imaginary' rather than a 'national identity'. In this respect, German cinema in the Weimar period anticipated some of the problems facing contemporary nations in reconstituting their identities by means of media images, memory and invented traditions. -- from back cover","2000","2024-03-29 21:59:59","2024-04-26 19:53:09","","161-165, 191-192","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","London","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 963362687","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In The Cosmic Web, N. Katherine Hayles seeks to establish the scope of the field concept and to assess its importance for contemporary thought. She then explores the literary strategies that are attributable directly or indirectly to the new paradigm; among the texts at which she looks closely are Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Nabokov's Ada, D.H. Lawrence's early novels and essays, Borges's fiction, and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow","2018","2024-03-29 22:01:18","2024-08-08 18:42:51","","168-197","","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University Press","Ithaca","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 1028956772","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To chart the shift from irony to postirony, and show what relationship culture has to politics, the book offers intensive analyses of important American countercultural figures: the hipster, the punk, a figure the author calls ""the believer,"" the coolhunter, and the occupier; and new interpretations of important works by Ralph Ellison, Thomas Pynchon, William S.

"RG6NMSLS","bookSection","2016","Melley, Timothy","""Bodies Incorporated""","Empire of Conspiracy: the Culture of Paranoia in Postwar America","978-1-5017-1301-9","","","","Why, Timothy Melley asks, have paranoia and conspiracy theory become such prominent features of postwar American culture? In Empire of Conspiracy, Melley explores the recent growth of anxieties about thought-control, assassination, political indoctrination, stalking, surveillance, and corporate and government plots. At the heart of these developments, he believes, lies a widespread sense of crisis in the way Americans think about human autonomy and individuality. Nothing reveals this crisis more than the remarkably consistent form of expression that Melley calls ""agency panic""--An intense fear that individuals can be shaped or controlled by powerful external forces. Drawing on a broad range of forms that manifest this fear--including fiction, film, television, sociology, political writing, self-help literature, and cultural theory--Melley provides a new understanding of the relation between postwar American literature, popular culture, and cultural theory. Empire of Conspiracy offers insightful new readings of texts ranging from Joseph Heller's Catch-22 to the Unabomber Manifesto, from Vance Packard's Hidden Persuaders to recent addiction discourse, and from the ""stalker"" novels of Margaret Atwood and Diane Johnson to the conspiracy fictions of Thomas Pynchon, William Burroughs, Don DeLillo, and Kathy Acker. Throughout, Melley finds recurrent anxieties about the power of large organizations to control human beings. These fears, he contends, indicate the continuing appeal of a form of individualism that is no longer wholly accurate or useful, but that still underpins a national fantasy of freedom from social control","2016","2024-03-29 22:03:12","2024-05-17 18:29:39","","81-106","","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University Press","Ithaca","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 964412121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book is a postmortem of the supposed death of painting in the period following World War II. In eleven essays by a global array of leading scholars, Ends of Painting offers a counter-history, showing how the practice and discourse of painting remained integral to art throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Written by art historians from Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America, each chapter captures a renewed critical approach to topics as diverse as conceptualism and anachronism, photography and autobiography, theater and politics, nationalism and consumerism, race and modernism.0The book reveals a vast constellation in which painting?s ends are also beginnings?from Warhol?s Cow Wallpaper at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York to Naoyoshi Hikosaka?s act of pouring latex over tatami mats on his bedroom floor in Tokyo; from the first canvas boards by Aboriginal artists at Papunya in Australia?s Western Desert to the Collective Actions Group?s documentation of people holding up arrangements of colored envelopes in snowfields outside Moscow. These unlikely correspondences between times and places sustain this book?s return to the medium. It reveals how history is brushed by painting, and painting by history","2022","2024-03-29 22:08:32","2024-03-29 22:08:32","","","","","","","","Ends of painting","","","","","Power publications","Sydney","eng","","","","","BnF ISBN","759.06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

""Das geordnete Chaos"", ID 48/92). Dass er auch als Literaturhistoriker überzeugen kann, hatte er bereits 1988 mit dem Abdruck einer Vorlesungsreihe aus dem Wintersemester 1987/88 unter Beweis gestellt (BA 11/88), die jetzt erstmals wiederaufgelegt wird. Auch über 20 Jahre nach der Erstedition hat dieser - exemplarisch angelegte - Überblick über die Geschichte des Romans im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert nichts von seiner Plausibilität und Faszination verloren. Die 20 Autorenporträts (Verlag:...beginnend mit Cervantes führt sie über Balzac, Flaubert, Tolstoi und Dostojewski zu Kafka, Joyce, Thomas Mann und vielen anderen, um bei Beckett und Pynchon zu enden...) von Stendhal bis Thomas Pynchon eignen sich überdies auch gut als eine 1.

Cries of 6 newborns in this preliminary study were recorded in a pain condition after a prick for the hematic check-up the third day after delivery and then while crying spontaneously in the cradle. The sounds were sampled at 44100 Hz with a 16-bit resolution and converted to the way format. All the analyses were performed with a software written in the MATLAB© environment. The most important result was that these new-born children modulated the supralaryngeal tract considerably more in cries following the painful stimulus than in “spontaneous” ones, as would be expected by the hypothesis of crying as “protolanguage.”","2002-12","2024-03-29 22:22:51","2024-03-29 22:22:51","2024-03-29 22:22:51","752-754","","3","95","","Percept Mot Skills","Crying of a Newborn Child","","","","","","","en","http://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cries of 6 newborns in this preliminary study were recorded in a pain condition after a prick for the hematic check-up the third day after delivery and then while crying spontaneously in the cradle. The sounds were sampled at 44100 Hz with a 16-bit resolution and converted to the way format. All the analyses were performed with a software written in the MATLAB© environment. The most important result was that these new-born children modulated the supralaryngeal tract considerably more in cries following the painful stimulus than in “spontaneous” ones, as would be expected by the hypothesis of crying as “protolanguage.”","2002-12","2024-03-29 22:24:13","2024-03-29 22:24:13","2024-03-29 22:24:13","752-754","","3","95","","Percept Mot Skills","Crying of a Newborn Child","","","","","","","en","http://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It investigates how the novel redefines and enlarges concepts of identity by exploring several aspects of sameness and selfhood exposed to a very special kind of migration: Being in two places, countries, or worlds at the same time, a multiplicity of characters in Against The Day opt for the excluded middle when a fork in the road presents itself. The paper investigates these new forms of identity in the novel and explores their impact on philosophical concepts such as the notion of a seamless continuity of identity, the role of subjectivity for identity, and the concept of a narrative identity.","2009","2024-03-29 23:15:41","2024-03-29 23:15:41","2024-03-29 23:15:41","33-52","","","2","","aspeers","Bilocated Identities","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/DV7FXMPK/Aghoro - 2009 - Bilocated Identities Taking the Fork in the Road .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking that cryptic comment as a starting point and drawing on Giovanni Arrighi's account of the recurrent organization of capital by metropolitan “spaces-of-flows,” this essay investigates what it might mean for Mason's comment to be true of both his late-eighteenth-century moment and the late-twentieth-century moment of the novel's publication and asks what such a reading of the “form [of] the world” implies for contemporary attempts to rethink literary study under the sign of the global. The essay offers “laws” of such a global form (expansion contracts, contraction enriches, enrichment haunts) and deploys them to read the two modes of globalized literary study that have achieved dominance of late: global literary study as method and as project—the key method in question understood here as a type of global historicism and the key project as the appeal to reconfigure literary study as the study of something called global literature.","2001-01","2024-03-29 23:16:15","2024-03-29 23:16:15","2024-03-29 23:16:15","158-172","","1","116","","Publ.

Engaging in a shadow polemic on the historiographical responsibilities of the literary artist, Pynchon critiques a burgeoning technology (the Internet) and the economic order it serves. He presents the Deep Web as a virtual unconscious, a “dark archive” beneath the surface Web. In his probing of this digital arkhē , Pynchon escorts the reader into an abyss previously explored by Nietzsche, Freud, and Derrida. Like them, he finds repression, death wish, “archive fever,” and the oblivion from which life emerges and to which it returns.","2013-09","2024-03-29 23:21:41","2024-03-29 23:21:41","2024-03-29 23:21:41","","","1","24","","pmc","“Down on the Barroom Floor of History”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scientific metafiction accordingly is marked by a refusal of the view that only science has a truth claim and by comparing science and fiction as discourses. Thomas Pynchon’s novels are exemplary historiographic metafictions, and I argue that the growing importance of science and scientific metafiction is crucial to the development of the ontological dominant that, according to Brian McHale, characterises postmodernist fiction. Focusing on three novels from the 1970s to the twenty-first century, I demonstrate that the concept of scientific metafiction and its negotiation of concerns also discussed in science studies are central to Pynchon’s work and crucial to its move beyond the epistemological questioning of historiographic metafiction and towards raising ontological concerns.","2016-06-01","2024-03-29 23:22:51","2024-03-29 23:22:51","2024-03-29 23:22:51","189-205","","2","64","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moving beyond a thematic reading of sexuality, the article articulates the unacknowledged theoretical similarities between postmodernist ontological instability and queer resistances to teleology. Building on the theoretical work of Brian McHale and Lee Edelman, I argue that Pynchon’s representations of sadomasochism in Gravity’s Rainbow become a destabilizing narrative force that queers Pynchon’s poetics. With a focus on Margherita Erdmann’s sexual practice, this revisionary reading of gender and female sexuality in Pynchon complicates previous criticism, which has largely condemned the heteromasculinity of high postmodernism and elided the power of female sexual agency in such texts.","2017-06-01","2024-03-29 23:23:07","2024-03-29 23:23:07","2024-03-29 23:23:07","141-166","","2","63","","","Queer Postmodern Practices","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a sense of loss for these “missing contents” marks modernist and postmodernist literature, this sense seems more evident in texts written by men than in texts written by women. Women's texts that convey these missing contents do not look backward toward past master narratives. Rather, what is missing is the “not yet presented,” that which has not yet come into range. This pattern of bifurcation in modernism and postmodernism suggests that male texts are more readily adopted into the canon than female texts are because their nostalgic stance toward the past binds them, as female texts generally are not bound, to the long reach of the male Western narrative tradition.

In his piece “Genre as History,” Brian McHale asserts that Against the Day pastiches several literary genres from the turn of the twentieth century, but this essay argues that Against the Day deals more broadly with the history of emergent media that come to shape reality according to capitalist interests. Merle Rideout, a character linked to camera technologies, and Lew Basnight, who represents print media, remain strangers for the first thousand pages of an eleven-hundred-page novel. Their meeting in 1920s Hollywood demonstrates not only the historical collision of print and visual media but also the latter's eclipse of the former. Reading Merle's Integroscope as anticipating later Internet technology, this essay ends by grappling with the persistence of print media in the twenty-first century that Against the Day consciously embodies.","2014-07-01","2024-03-29 23:26:24","2024-03-29 23:26:24","2024-03-29 23:26:24","141-170","","2","47","","","“Clearer Than Real”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, the analysis demonstrates the impact of cinematography within Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, emphasizing intermedial reflexivity from screen to paper, its unfolding and animation, representations and mutations, but also the notion that virtuality dominates actuality (Virilio, The Vision 63), or, in Deleuze’s terms, the two coalesce within the crystal-image, for the real and the imaginary, the actual and the virtual, although distinct, are indiscernible (Deleuze, Cinema 2 68-69). The study is grounded in Paul Virilio’s theoretical framework and his criticism of the colonization of the real by the virtual, and in Gilles Deleuze’s account on cinematic taxonomy and how cinematography partakes in the emergence of a new notion of reality and history. By appropriating, repurposing, and reshaping the techniques, forms, and contents of cinematography, and at the same time being critical of its effects, Pynchon uses paper surface for transition of his ideas, validating the repercussions of intermediation as a cultural force and unveiling literature’s performativity, its ability to shelter/entertain the “cinematic,” which in turn revolutionizes and animates fiction.","2017-11-27","2024-03-29 23:26:51","2024-03-29 23:26:51","2024-03-29 23:26:51","257-269","","1","1","","","“Cinematic” Gravity’s Rainbow","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/R4598JA9/Grmusa - 2017 - “Cinematic” Gravity’s Rainbow Indiscernibility of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gerald Graff, par exemple, a dénoncé la déconstruction comme une fuite devant les problèmes de la société moderne. Graff voit « la même influence débilitante s 'exercer dans le genre de fiction postmoderniste pratiqué par des écrivains comme Thomas Pynchon ». Si le réalisme est simplement un problème de convention dominante ne s 'attachant pas plus à la vérité que d'autres modes d'écriture plus artificiels, alors c 'est la porte ouverte, selon Graff, à « un scepticisme général que ne reconnaît que le jeu infini du texte». Thomas Pynchon, le représentant le plus éminent et le symbole le plus durable de cette époque semble effectivement travailler sur des thèmes qui font écho aux assertions postmodernistes sur l'inscrutabilité, la relativité et enfin de compte la subjectivité de la réalité.

The carnival lacks the mock king, and the  historical novel lacks the leader who embodies history. The explanation  here is paradoxically historicist.               Gravity's Rainbow               explicitly addresses a  constructed audience (in the Orpheus Theatre) in the Cold War and is               about               the formation of the Cold War in its techno-bureaucratic context. The               realpolitik               of authority in the Cold War context has changed. Bureaucratic  constructions of System operate as the               modus operandi               for authority in the  novel and they parallel the historical formation of Systems theory and  analysis with such US organizations as               RAND               . This development  represents, in the technologies and the discourses of the military and  political strategists, a response to Hitler and the supposed tyranny and  threat of Communism. The series of characters we encounter within the  novel reflects different forms of entrapment and/or lines of flight in  response to the authority of the System in what John Johnston has called  an assemblage, or postmodern multiplicity. Containment and counterforce  become metaphors which Pynchon scurrilously uses to subvert the  moral righteousness of the Western Cold Warriors in their defense of a  “free world” (paradoxically) under siege from an ever threatening  Communism. Pynchon is interested not in the great historical figure, but  in the relation of the individual to the System, militarily, scientifically,  socially, and sexually.","1999-12","2024-03-29 23:26:58","2024-03-29 23:26:58","2024-03-29 23:26:58","417-436","","3","33","","J.

This study uses contextual and exegetical methods to consider how Pynchon uses Rilke alongside and through his characters to engage critically with the poet's late work, reading it to explore wider issues. Weimar bourgeois irrationality as preparation for Nazism; the redundancy of German existentialism; and Rilke's neo-Romanticism as the representative of a volkisch culture unconsciously rooted in the fetish of the commodity, all come under scrutiny.","2012-06","2024-03-29 23:27:19","2024-03-29 23:27:19","2024-03-29 23:27:19","308-333","","2","58","","mfs","""Gravity rushes through him""","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The calculated failure of the discussion leads, in the second part, to a new framing of literary texts and their criticism that pivots on Niklas Luhmann's systems theory and his medium / form distinction in particular. The writings of Thomas Pynchon and the criticism of the so-called Pyndustry will help exemplify this model, which conceptualizes hyperfictions and their reading / criticism from a new angle. At the same time, the article demonstrates that Gravity's Rainbow, a novel which critics have frequently read in terms of - or even as - film, can equally be focalized not only as prefiguring hypertextuality, but as a case in point for a hypertextual-like collaborative enterprise on the level of its criticism.","2006-07-01","2024-03-29 23:27:28","2024-03-29 23:27:28","2024-03-29 23:27:28","299-311","","3","54","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novel appears to subvert traditional definitions of plot and characterization, yet the narrative retains a nagging sense of order underneath the represented chaos. Simultaneously evoking and undoing patterns on all levels of its narrative structure, Gravity’s Rainbow surreptitiously evokes the presence of a night journey (Martindale, 1979). An empirical content analysis of the novel confirms this ambiguous attitude with respect to patterning in the novel, and thus constitutes a first and modest step towards the quantification of postmodernism. First, a thematic analysis, calculating the co-variations of words across the chapters, corroborates the idea of a connectedness that seems to belie, in part, the pervasive presence of a paranoid hermeneutic. Second, a dictionary-based analysis of narrative sequences reveals an inverse night journey pattern that differs markedly from other patterns found for modernist novels. The configurations that were obtained in these analyses show that content analysis can distinguish empirically between two literary - historical concepts.","2003-02","2024-03-29 23:27:34","2024-03-29 23:27:34","2024-03-29 23:27:34","27-41","","1","12","","Language and Literature","Pynchon, postmodernism and quantification","","","","","","","en","http://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mi parecer, hay marcadas resonancias de Cervantes en este cuento posiblemente influido por la interpretación del Quijote de V. Nabokov, uno de los profesores de Pynchon. Como don Quijote, el protagonista Flange decide buscar aventuras. Aburrido de su vida respetable y mal comprendido por su mujer, Flange sale de su casa acompañado del grosero marinero Pig Bodine, antiguo compañero suyo que se parece un poco a un Sancho degenerado. Una noche el soñador Flange obedece a la llamada de una hermosa “gitanilla” y desciende con ella a un basurero misterioso, para soñar despierto sus ensueños, como don Quijote en la cueva de Montesinos. En contraste, sin embargo, con el desenlace desengañado del Quijote, el joven Pynchon cierra su cuento con Flange perdido en un mundo fantástico, prefiriendo jugar a la vida con la pequeñita Nerissa.","1988-03","2024-03-29 23:27:50","2024-03-29 23:27:50","2024-03-29 23:27:50","47-53","","1","8","","Cervantes","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

De la misma manera que don Quijote crea a Dulcinea a partir de los “disparatados” libros de caballerías, Herbert Stencil —soltero cincuentón obsesionado— crea a V. a partir de los cuadernos personales de su padre. Al igual que en el caso de Dulcinea, V. se puede interpretar como una influencia positiva o negativa en la loca búsqueda de su creador.

Thomas Pynchon's               Vineland               is read as a critique of individualism that regrets the loss of collective identity and purpose. A subsequent reading of Katherine Dunn's               Geek Love               demonstrates the destructive consequences of individual submission that draws parallels between the dynamics of “cult” communities and mainstream society. This is developed further in a discussion of Don DeLillo's               Mao II               , which is represented as an attempt to reconcile libertarian and communitarian discourses, while remaining mindful of the dangers of both.","2008-04","2024-03-29 23:28:10","2024-03-29 23:28:10","2024-03-29 23:28:10","35-50","","1","42","","J.

Frequent and heavy alcohol consumption is a feature of both Thomas Pynchon's               Against the Day               and John Dos Passos's               USA               trilogy, but the way in which these authors describe heavy drinking – and hedonistic behaviour in general – indicates fundamental differences between the modernism of Dos Passos and Pynchon's postmodernist strategies. The article contends that this aspect of Pynchon's novel represents a critique of attitudes within the twentieth-century American left towards sensuality, patriarchy and the failure of leftist aspiration within a contemporary context that invokes such subjects as the complicity of consumption, terrorism and the ethics of political assassination.","2014-02","2024-03-29 23:28:11","2024-03-29 23:28:11","2024-03-29 23:28:11","173-198","","1","48","","J.

The Reaganite media appropriations of representations of the 1960s cultural and political revolution and mediated history of the political betrayals that contributed to the failure of political communities in the 1960s and 1970s are coupled in Pynchon's novel with an aesthetic reflection about the relationship between mimesis and fidelity. The utopian promise in Vineland is presented as inseparable from violent irruptions of past traumas into the present. In invoking a spectralized traumatic history of America, Pynchon inscribes the novel in the tradition of cryptomimetic writing. In conclusion it is demonstrated that, according to the writer, contingent and imperfect utopian solidarity with the living and the dead is the only, precarious, mainstay against fascist appropriations of the narrative of America.","2018-07-01","2024-03-29 23:30:10","2024-03-29 23:30:10","2024-03-29 23:30:10","197-211","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The discussion ranges from Julia Kristeva and Brit Art to Don DeLillo, Bret Easton Ellis, Thomas Pynchon, Donald Barthelme and Jonathan Franzen. If the realm of the sign insists  upon a cleaned-up, happy and healthy world of the real, in which all oppositions can be mediated or negotiated away, and in which the merely human is seen as powerless and determined from the outside by immense state and economic power as well as from the inside by the psychological imperatives  of brand names, insistence on the designer body, and the manipulation of desire, the situation of the human is becoming increasingly that of abjection. This concept is partly thought about by way of Kristeva's psychoanalytical formulation, but more than that in terms of what might be called  a pyscho-cultural appreciation of the way that patterns, usually seen in terms of individual acculturation based on Freudian and Lacanian understandings, seem also to operate in the wider field of society. Critical interest in this theory so far has been primarily located within the context  of gothic and horror fiction, but arguably the question of abjection is only fully to be understood in this wider framework of resistance to the colonization of the sign, and of meaning itself. In short, the artistic fascination with abjection represents the oppositional production of an antithesis  to colonized and cleaned-up meaning structures, an in-your-face riposte to what we might call, rather than a brave new world, a clean new world.","2005-12-01","2024-03-29 23:30:22","2024-03-29 23:30:22","2024-03-29 23:30:22","191-203","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thomas Pynchon's canon is wilfully idiosyncratic and frequently apocryphal, but his epigraphs are no less apposite than George Eliot's; for in creating a fictional world out of what is largely palpable history Pynchon produces a homogenous medium which is neither fiction nor history. I have chosen the epigraph above because in addition to illustrating this admixture of fiction and history it also intimates to the reader an aspect of Pynchon's technique which may go some way towards explaining the rationale behind it. Some parts of               Gravity's Rainbow               , I think, might best be described as an attempt at writing a twentieth century “gospel.”                                         The Oxyrhynchus papyri, referred to in the epigraph actually exist. They were discovered in 1898 and 1904 in Egypt, and were fragments of purported sayings of Jesus of Nazareth dating from the second century A.D. Not until 1956, when the translation of a gnostic library discovered at Nag Hammedai in Egypt was completed, did it become clear that the Oxyrhynchus papyri were fragments of a work calling itself the               Gospel of Thomas               .","1985-04","2024-03-29 23:30:35","2024-03-29 23:30:35","2024-03-29 23:30:35","69-80","","1","19","","J.

New syntactic and lexical choices made by Pynchon when rewriting his early short story “Under the Rose” as chapter 3 in the novel V. are analyzed in the light of the changes they bring about in the transitivity of the clause and consequently in the reader's conceptualizing of the fictional world, especially the characters. The analysis is grounded on cognitive theories of information processing, and on the assumption that language form is not fortuitous, but performs a communicative function.","2002-12-01","2024-03-29 23:30:40","2024-03-29 23:30:40","2024-03-29 23:30:40","633-656","","4","23","","","From “Under the Rose” to <i>V</i> .","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While, in Vineland, the activist film collective 24fps attempts to resist governmental power, their instrumentalization of their media technology (the film camera) leads to their own appropriation by hegemonic forces. Instead, it is the Thanatoids, liminal creatures inextricably linked with the television, who disrupt the control apparatus and present both a resistant (post)human body and a revolutionary new politics.","2014-01","2024-03-29 23:31:00","2024-03-29 23:31:00","2024-03-29 23:31:00","101-121","","1","44","","Canadian Review of American Studies","The Frame-Breakers","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He employs science as a metaphor, a guiding schema for his art. an esthetic model representing the phenomenal and spiritual worlds. For Wittgenstein, of whom Pynchon makes multiple mention in V..1 ""Die Welt ist allés, was derFall ist. ""and for Pynchon the case is primarily one of disorder, heat-death, white noise, communication collapse and existential blur. In criticism concerning Pynchon's use of science as metaphor, one most often finds discussed the concept of entropy, in which nature, according to the second law of thermodynamics, will reach a state of maximum disorganization and minimum available energy, at which time all change will cease.2 Entropy is most often spoken about with respect to Pynchon's early stories and V. The next most commonly discussed scientific notion is that of white noise and distortion in information systems.-1 This appears in relation to all of Pynchon's work. Then comes ""Maxwell's Demon."" the idea of nineteenth-century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, who posed the existence of a small intelligent being who can sort out swifter and slower Molecules in a box divided into two compartments, thereby creating an inequality in energy (heat) without the expenditure of work.4 One usually finds ""Maxwell's Demon"" mentioned with respect to The Crying of Lot 49. very little criticism has been devoted to Pynchon's use of relativity theory. which emphasizes the subjectivity of the observer, and it appears most often in Conjunction with Gravity's Rainbow.","1983-05-01","2024-03-29 23:32:06","2024-03-29 23:32:06","2024-03-29 23:32:06","153-164","","2","14","","Canadian Review of American Studies","pynchon's New Nature","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With New World slavery jettisoning all notions of American exceptionalism, colonial faction preventing national consolidation, and the very shape of the earth making the actuality of America impossible to determine with any fixity, establishing what is American becomes an act of representation. Pynchon portrays that act as less a function of politics, as the colonists demanded, and more a question of aesthetics, as the pictorial mapping in which his surveyors engage illustrates.","2004-06","2024-03-29 23:32:07","2024-03-29 23:32:07","2024-03-29 23:32:07","283-302","","2","50","","mfs","A ""Patch of England, at a three-thousand-Mile Off-set""?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pynchon’s duplication of fictional and spectral characters intends to critique the notion of identity as does Deleuzian concept of repetition. Not attached to the representational concept of identity as the recurrence of the same, Pynchon’s duplications decenter the transcendental concept in favor of a perpetual becoming and reproduces difference and singularity. Like Deleuze, Pynchon eschews an identity that is always guaranteed, and shows that the repetition of an object or a subject is not the recurrence of the original self-identical object or person. Moreover, Iceland spar, the mystifying calcite, with its doubling effect provides the reader with a view of a world beyond the ordinary, actual world, which is quite similar to what Pynchon’s novel does per se.","2018-09-01","2024-03-29 23:33:37","2024-08-24 23:51:41","2024-03-29 23:33:37","953-960","","5","9","","JLTR","Pynchon’s Against the Day","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/4FUPXS27/Salami and Rahmani - 2018 - Pynchon’s Against the Day Bilocation, Duplication.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This essay opens by considering disturbances legible in Fredric Jameson's proposal of a postmodern sublime, then goes on to consider narratives by Thomas Pynchon that interrogate and allegorize the burdens of such a proposition. From the early short stories to               V.               and               Gravity's Rainbow               , Pynchon's texts develop increasingly complex stagings of the sublime, putting into question the psychological and epistemological consolations that these scenarios exist to afford.","1989-03","2024-03-29 23:33:43","2024-03-29 23:33:43","2024-03-29 23:33:43","152-162","","2","104","","Publ.

Setting up the idea of the nation as imagined communities coming together through shared narratives, Morrison and Pynchon probe the possibility of future national imaginings through narratives which continually breakdown in establishing the past. In the seeming paradox of narrating pasts that destroy and delimit the future, their novels display the disjuncture between the need to narrate the nation and the collective narratives that often emerge to define national boundaries. Their texts point toward the limits of national imaginings and spaces that unsuccessfully map onto the populations they purport to represent. In the context of the transnational turn in American studies, foundational narratives signal national narratives as self-destructive operations of power that can compel a populace to construct space–less histories and obscure social relations. Simultaneously, foundational narratives can also signal spaces beyond national boundaries, understandings of the nation as transnational and reliant on fictional modes in order to reestablish historical and social links.","2014-06","2024-03-29 23:35:18","2024-03-29 23:35:18","2024-03-29 23:35:18","69-94","","3","2014","","lit","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accounts of the influence of Seattle on Pynchon have been limited to his work as a Boeing technical writer, and Century 21 goes unmentioned in work on the novel’s allusions by Steven Weisenburger and others. Pynchon responds throughout Gravity’s Rainbow to Century 21, particularly its Cold War views of space-age futurism and nuclear weapons. I draw new connections between the angel of Lübeck and John Glenn’s World’s Fair appearance; aspects of the Raketen-Stadt and the fair’s US Science Pavilion; and Pynchon’s many towers and elevators and that signature feature of Century 21, the Space Needle. The conclusion attends to the fair’s traces in Against the Day and Bleeding Edge, demonstrating Pynchon’s nearly career-long fascination with the event.","2016-06-01","2024-03-29 23:35:57","2024-03-29 23:35:57","2024-03-29 23:35:57","145-169","","2","62","","","“A City of the Future”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recurrent object of critical interest in this body of comic writing was the function of ""blackness"" in the formation of ""white"" identities. In Bruce Jay Friedman's ""Black Angels"" and Terry Southern's ""Twirlin' At Ole Miss"" desperate individuals are shown negotiating their sense of self in ambivalent exchanges with an imaginary other. Thomas Pynchon, in ""The Secret Integration,"" analyzes an adolescent act of imitation across racial lines as an effort to overcome socially prescribed differences. And in ""Lost in the Funhouse,"" John Barth locates racialized fantasy as a constitutive element of sexual maturation.","2003-09","2024-03-29 23:36:41","2024-03-29 23:36:41","2024-03-29 23:36:41","469-495","","3","49","","mfs","Secret Integrations","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And, responsive to his work's richness, critical attention has in due course been paid to a myriad of topics he has examined. One important subject, however, has not been ade- quately addressed in Pynchonian scholarship. No sustained effort has been made to see Pynchon's work as embracing a determinate political stance or political philosophy.1 It is the latter that will provide the focus of this essay. It should be said from the outset that important features of postmodern American fiction have discouraged readers from looking for philosophical coherence of any sort. As reflected in various works by, for example, Walter Abish, Paul Auster, Frederick Barth, Robert Coover, Raymond Federman, William Gass, Gilbert Sorrentino, and Ronald Sukenick, unrelieved epistem- ological doubt and antic involution of form do not provide the method- ological foundations for a coherent political philosophy. Scepticism typically yields local and often ambiguous insights, not comprehensive understanding. And for its part, formal experimentation—and certainly postmodern fiction's recurrent obsession with parody—inevitably invites readings that, advertently or otherwise, emphasize aesthetic autonomy.2 In the case of Pynchon, readers have quite astutely identified the general lines of his critique of modern America and Western civilization as a whole, but, with rare exception, Pynchon's political philosophy has typically been either overlooked or reduced to an amorphous postmodern disillusionment or some sort of dark pessimism or even disappointed humanism.3","1995-12-01","2024-03-29 23:37:43","2024-03-29 23:37:43","2024-03-29 23:37:43","63-100","","3","25","","Canadian Review of American Studies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In his latest novel, Pynchon labors in the time-honored generic trenches of American “hardboiled fiction” to elaborate the transformative energies of what California still stands for as worlding edge-space, as a temporal promise of social transformation and popular-cultural redemption not quite over. In bleaker plot strands, we witness an American vernacular revolution of pop-carnivalesque energies being infiltrated and hollowed out, as if the utopic energies of the 1960s were foreclosed at birth by the security apparatus of police forces, land development, and the global totality of capital as situated on the Pacific Rim.","2010-05-01","2024-03-29 23:38:09","2024-03-29 23:38:09","2024-03-29 23:38:09","217-225","","2","37","","","On the Pacific Edge of Catastrophe, or Redemption","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brown—               Life against Death               and               Love's Body               . Brown's neo-Freudian view of               repression               as the source of man's uniqueness in nature is mirrored in virtually every thematic aspect of               Gravity's Rainbow               . In one sense, the physical gravity of the title is a metaphor for the human repression that engages Pynchon on the psychological level. Pynchon's understanding of history, like Brown's, reflects “the slow return of the repressed.” Other themes include the hypertrophy of the death instinct as manifested in weapons of destruction, the pernicious influence of Calvinist dualism opposing true dialectics, the interdependent abuses of sexuality and power, and the need for an antirational conception of art based in transcendental symbolism. The novel enacts the struggle of life against death, and its style affirms man's freedom.","1977-10","2024-03-29 23:38:13","2024-03-29 23:38:13","2024-03-29 23:38:13","873-889","","5","92","","Publ.

This book is a postmortem of the supposed death of painting in the period following World War II. In eleven essays by a global array of leading scholars, Ends of Painting offers a counter-history, showing how the practice and discourse of painting remained integral to art throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Written by art historians from Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America, each chapter captures a renewed critical approach to topics as diverse as conceptualism and anachronism, photography and autobiography, theater and politics, nationalism and consumerism, race and modernism.0The book reveals a vast constellation in which painting?s ends are also beginnings?from Warhol?s Cow Wallpaper at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York to Naoyoshi Hikosaka?s act of pouring latex over tatami mats on his bedroom floor in Tokyo; from the first canvas boards by Aboriginal artists at Papunya in Australia?s Western Desert to the Collective Actions Group?s documentation of people holding up arrangements of colored envelopes in snowfields outside Moscow. These unlikely correspondences between times and places sustain this book?s return to the medium. It reveals how history is brushed by painting, and painting by history","2022","2024-05-18 18:02:03","2024-05-18 18:02:03","","","","","","","","Ends of painting","","","","","Power publications","Sydney","eng","","","","","BnF ISBN","759.06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(Dorothy arriving in Oz: epigraph to Part 3 of Gravity's Rainbow) ""Why... is everybody so interested in texts?"" ( The Crying of Lot 49) ""If,"" Roland Barthes asserted in his inaugural lecture in the Chair of Literary Semiology at the Collège de France, ""by some unimaginable excess""' all but one of our learned disciplines ""were to be expelled from our education sys- tem, it is the discipline of Literature which would have to be saved, for all knowledge, all the sciences, are present in the literary monument.""' That is a large claim and, coming from the iconoclastic semiologist of S/Z and Le Plaisir du Texte, gratifyingly soothing to beleaguered humanists. It is after all in part because of Barthes, Foucault, Derrida and other members of the French nouvelle critique that the much-cherished American insistence on the autonomy of the literary text and the uniqueness of the artistic vision has been so disturbingly and fundamentally challenged in recent years. With Barthes on our side after all, are we perhaps permitted to see texts as more than nodes within differential networks of significance carrying with them an illimitable force of multiple, disseminated meaning? Perhaps we can cau- tiously continue to privilege ""literature"" as society's unusually acute under- standing (or lack of understanding) of itself? Celebrating the festival of words, we might after all learn to cheat the facticity of the world.","1983-05-01","2024-06-28 15:34:55","2024-06-28 15:34:55","2024-06-28 15:34:55","207-218","","2","14","","Canadian Review of American Studies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After first considering some of the problems surrounding the concept of realism – its historical lineage, conflation with philosophical realism and the changing nature of reality itself – I discuss Pynchon's novels in terms of his technological construction of reality effects within a context of ontological doubt. I suggest that in Pynchon we arrive at what might be called a ‘baroque realism’, which draws on the Deleuzian metaphor of the fold, and is concerned with questions of illusion and reality, paradox and complexity in tune with the ontological uncertainty that characterises the age.","2008-01","2024-06-28 19:20:16","2024-06-28 19:20:16","2024-06-28 19:20:16","11-19","","1","5","","Literature Compass","Thomas Pynchon","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Icecap is clearly of tectonic significance, but, because of its tectonic history, it is uplifted and rugged, and consequently inaccessible. Therefore the distribution of geophysical observations which can be acquired in a rugged field area is dependent on the tectonic history. This suggests that a tectonic history which is reconstructed from geophysical data may be systematically biased.             We use models of local and flexural isostasy to estimate the gravity errors associated with interpolation across inaccessible topography. The gravity error is largest for Pratt isostasy, where the mass deficit which supports the topography is at relatively shallow depths. The gravity error is least for flexural isostasy, because in this case the inaccessible topography is supported regionally by a mass deficit which extends beyond the inaccessible region.             An analytical flexural interpolation scheme is proposed for interpolation across data gaps associated with inaccessible topography. Flexural theory and Gauss’s theorem are used to predict the gravity anomaly due to the mass excess of the inaccessible topography. We apply this scheme to the North Patagonian Icecap, to demonstrate that flexural interpolation predicts a relative gravity low at the site of the Icecap, which would not be predicted by purely geometrical interpolation schemes.","1997-11","2024-06-28 19:29:30","2024-06-28 19:29:30","2024-06-28 19:29:30","1013-1026","","6","45","","Geophysical Prospecting","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pierce—a 1960s war profiteer, maker of soulless cityscapes, and&nbsp;master manipulator—is justifiably seen as a villain. But he is also the novel’s most effective agent; he&nbsp;manipulates the culture he discovers and cultivates instabilities from which he profits.&nbsp;Lot 49’s&nbsp;protagonist, Oedipa Maas, habitually looks for central managers in control of the culture, but Pierce is&nbsp;not that. Instead, he is an often subtle persuader who designs ephemeral spaces that invite the agency of&nbsp;outsiders. He counts on the creative misuses people may find for his products. He does not have his&nbsp;community’s best interests at heart, but he demonstrates what it means to come alongside a community&nbsp;and foster gradual change. Pynchon—by making his villain an effective community change agent—sharpens his critique of middle-class complacency: Oedipa recoils from the decentralized cultural&nbsp;complexity that Pierce welcomes. Pynchon suggests that so long as Oedipa and her clever, educated&nbsp;cohort think of society as the product of other powerful ruling minds, agents like Pierce will have the&nbsp;advantage, as they diffuse their self-serving innovations through the networks of contemporary life,&nbsp;unchecked.","2023-08-06","2024-06-28 20:28:35","2024-08-23 17:26:42","2024-06-28 20:28:35","1-23","","1","11","","","Selling San Narciso","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/ZBNAGS2F/Johnson - 2023 - Selling San Narciso Pierce Inverarity as Insider-.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My reading focuses on the partial and incomplete nature of Pynchon’s Pentecostal revelation in terms of both communication and community. Drawing on the deconstructive notion of the messianic as articulated by Jacques Derrida and John Caputo, I argue that reading Pynchon’s Pentecostal imagery in a messianic mode serves to highlight the tension between solipsism and desire for community in the novel, and additionally illuminates Pynchon’s framing of the possibility for alternative community outside of the normative.","2024-06","2024-06-28 20:34:52","2024-06-28 20:34:52","2024-06-28 20:34:52","260-276","","2","73","","chy","“The Zany Paraclete”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conspiracy theories are narratives, and their narrative form provides the structure within which their 'readers' situate themselves when interpreting the world and its history. At the same time, conspiracist interpretations of the world may then be transmediated into works of literature and import popular discourse into narrative structures. The suppression and disappearance of books themselves may generate conspiracy theories and become co-opted into political dissent. Additionally, literary criticism itself is shown to adopt conspiracist modes of interpretation. By examining conspiracy plots as literary plots, with narrative, rhetorical, and symbolic characteristics, this volume is the first systematic study of how conspiracy culture in American and European history is the consequence of its interactions with literature. This book will be of great interest to researchers of conspiracy theories, literature, and literary criticism""--","2022","2024-06-28 20:39:32","2024-06-28 20:40:01","","","","","","","","","Conspiracy theories","","","","Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group","London New York","eng","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","","","Carver, Ben; Craciun, Dana; Christov, Todor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These works are closely connected, and can be effectively viewed as two parts of a single transmedia text which includes a novel, a film, and two trailers. All of the constituent parts of this meta-Inherent Vice are informed by their engagement with nostalgia. Yet it is precisely here that the texts diverge from each other most markedly, activating different types of nostalgia for different purposes. While much contemporary scholarship relies on Svetlana Boym’s reflective/restorative binary to conceptualize the phenomenon of nostalgia, this reading argues that a public/personal divide offers another perhaps more appropriate lens to view the differences between the two versions of Inherent Vice. Pynchon’s novel emphasizes the political potential and social aspects of nostalgia, while Anderson’s film focuses on its personal, affective impact.","2020-11-21","2024-06-28 20:41:50","2024-06-28 20:41:50","2024-06-28 20:41:50","295-312","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","en","https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, this novel seems to be a time of reflection about all shifts and changes of detective fiction, starting from the Californian hard-boiled school and the postmodern anti-detective fiction to the contemporary noir. In Inherent Vice Pynchon shows his awareness and considerations about the genre tradition – to which some of his novels such as The Crying of Lot 49 belong– playing out a thought-provoking parodic representation of the detective story and its doom.

As a field-defining volume, the editor and the contributors are world leaders in this ever-exciting genre that includes some of the most important and influential writers of the 20th century: including Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Albert Camus. Ever puzzling and always refusing to be pinned down, this book does not attempt to define absurdist literature, but attempts to examine its major and minor players. As such, the field is indirectly defined by examining its constituent writers. Not only investigating the so-called ""Theatre of the Absurd,"" this volume wades quite deeply into absurdist fiction and absurdist poetry, expanding much of our previous sense of what constitutes absurdist literature.

Upon analysing the hypergeneric and heteroglottic aspect of the novel, by enumerating the possible classifications of the novel’s genre and facets of language variety, the study offers a new perspective on genre classification from the vantage point of Jacques Derrida’s philosophy, namely by the introduction of the term quasi-transcendental as the name of a superordinate genre, which could include not only Pynchon’s but also Derrida’s works. The recreation of a genre defined in this way in the act of translation consists in determining the pivotal elements in the text, which activate the process of signification concerning chains of binarities in Gravity’s Rainbow, i.e. the motifs of “interface” and “linearity” (related to the motif of “fold”, which could also become a diagrammatic model for the whole quasi-transcendental genre).

The main purpose is to explore the connection between L’écriture féminine and paranoia. This involves offering an outlining of both feminism and postmodernism in relation to the context of paranoia. In advocating for a revision of the traditional Western thought, Thomas Pynchon engages the concept of paranoia as a practice of mental liberation. We suggest that the contrast between the journeys undertaken by the female characters against that of the male characters reveals an appreciation for the female’s ability at resistance and the power of paranoia. The experience of the male characters demonstrates the price of anti-paranoia and succumbing to the authoritarian systems.","2022","2024-06-28 21:01:20","2024-06-28 21:02:42","","444-454","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, the article centers on twin aspects of Pynchon’s intertextual reframing of Eliot’s representation of the waste land. The first refers to the use of certain motifs and symbols of the poem, such as the narrator’s bouncy character, the living-dead condition of some personages, and the evocation of the violet hour. The second aspect concerns Pynchon’s versions of the figure of Belladonna as a “lady of situations” and her relationship with the notion of waste associated with mythic thinking, ethics, and the complexity of life. These themes are developed intensely in Pynchon’s oeuvre and are reflected in his complex experimental style.""","2022","2024-06-28 21:03:23","2024-06-28 21:03:29","2024-06-28 21:03:23","167-182","","85","","","recaesin","The Waste Land and the Release of Social Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/UT3TQ9WC/Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain) and Collado-Rodríguez - 2022 - The Waste Land and the Release of Social Energy A.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article uses Michael Rothberg's               The Implicated Subject               (2019) as the basis for analysis, and notably his argument that to be implicated in wrongdoing often involves a kind of structural blindness towards suffering elsewhere. In the case of               Bleeding Edge               , the protagonist, Maxine Tarnow, is implicated in the violence committed in order to secure the hegemony of neoliberalism. The article describes Maxine's gradual recognition of her own blindness, and hence of her implication in the harms perpetrated in the name of neoliberalism. It begins by noting that her experience of neoliberalism is one of process and of immaterial exchange. The second part of the article argues that the introduction of Nicholas Windust shows how neoliberalism may be an experience of rupture or trauma for those outside the developed world. Finally, with the 9/11 attacks on New York, the same violence rebounds against its source; the attacks therefore act as the final stage in Maxine's increasing awareness of her own implication.","2022-05","2024-06-28 21:40:08","2024-06-28 21:40:08","2024-06-28 21:40:08","320-347","","2","56","","J.

Drawing on specific concepts in urban and regional studies, the book provides a thorough examination of Pynchon’s spatial imaginary, where the reader comes to understand how his fiction tackles the socio-political and cultural consequences of urban restructuring in the contemporary city and the lives of its citizens. Pynchon’s depiction of California is further analyzed from mythical and environmental standpoints to shed light on his planetary vision and (post)postmodernist poetics in the span of nearly half a century. More broadly, the book’s geocritical and urban analyses of Pynchon’s fiction indicate what might take place concerning the future of urbanism, toward “planetary urbanization” and the formation of the “city region.”","2023","2024-06-28 21:47:32","2024-07-14 01:48:32","2024-06-28 21:47:32","","202","","","","","","","","","","Sapienza Università Editrice","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Publisher: Sapienza Università Editrice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of his novels also include certain features of detective fiction. In The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), the focus of Oedipa –a housewife whose name alludes to Oedipus of Sophocles— shifts to unravelling the mystery of a shadowy underground postal system, and she turns out to be an amateur ‘detective’. The challenge is that the ‘clues’ do not clarify the case, which may or may not be real. A similar pattern is available in Inherent Vice (2009), in which a professional, sandal-wearing, “pothead” detective, Larry “Doc” Sportello, is at work in 1970s California. Inherent Vice does not provide a clear, definitive resolution to the mysteries. Instead, the novel maintains ambiguity and open-endedness, allowing readers to reflect on the intricacies of the narrative and the nature of the quest itself. Thomas Pynchon plays with the detective genre by parodying generic conventions in both works. A parodic work, characterized by its dialogical nature, comically criticizes its target and simultaneously crystallizes its conventions. While utilizing recognizable tropes and characteristics of archetypal private investigators, Pynchon employs unconventional methods for solving the crime, ironic inversions, and absurdities to subvert the stereotypical portrayal of a detective. In this respect, Pynchon, with his examples of postmodern/ metaphysical detective stories, both nurtures and subverts the detective genre. In this paper, The Crying of Lot 49 and Inherent Vice are examined regarding how Pynchon both validates and questions the established norms of the traditional detective genre by using parody.           ,              Thomas Pynchon'ın romanları postmodernist özellikleriyle dikkat çeker. Bazı romanları polisiye kurgunun belirli özelliklerini de içerir. The Crying of Lot 49'da (1966), adı Sofokles'in Oidipus'una gönderme yapan ev hanımı Oedipa’nın odak noktası, karanlık bir yeraltı posta sisteminin gizemini çözmeye kayar ve kendisi amatör bir 'dedektif’e dönüşür. Buradaki zorluk, 'ipuçlarının' gerçek olabilecek ya da olmayabilecek vakayı açıklığa kavuşturmamasıdır. Benzer bir durum, profesyonel ve ""esrarkeş"" bir dedektif olan Larry ""Doc"" Sportello'nun 1970'lerin Kaliforniya'sında iş başında olduğu Inherent Vice (2009) eserinde de mevcuttur. Inherent Vice da gizemlere açık ve kesin bir çözüm getirmez. Bunun yerine, roman belirsizliği ve açık uçluluğu koruyarak okuyucuların anlatının incelikleri ve arayışın doğası üzerine düşünmelerine olanak tanır. Thomas Pynchon her iki eserinde de genel kabullerin parodisini yaparak dedektiflik türüyle oynar. Söyleşimsel doğasıyla nitelendirilen parodik bir eser, hedefini komik bir şekilde eleştirir ve aynı zamanda onun geleneklerini daha belirgin hale getirir. Pynchon, arketipik özel dedektiflerin bilindik özelliklerini kullanırken, suçu çözmek için alışılmadık yöntemler, ironik tersine çevirmeler ve absürtlükler kullanarak klişeleşmiş dedektif tasvirini altüst eder. Bu açıdan Pynchon, postmodern/metafizik dedektif örnekleriyle polisiye türünü hem besler hem de altüst eder. Bu makalede, Pynchon'ın The Crying of Lot 49 ve Inherent Vice eserlerinde parodiyi yoluyla geleneksel polisiye türünün yerleşik normlarını nasıl hem tasdik edip hem de sorguladığı incelenmektedir.","2023-12-31","2024-06-28 21:54:57","2024-06-28 21:54:57","2024-06-28 21:54:57","753-770","","13","7","","","MYSTERIES UNRESOLVED","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/BZ6ESDXG/Koç - 2023 - MYSTERIES UNRESOLVED DETECTIVE FICTION AND PARODY.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And what is the drawing of a line if it is not also the creation of new objects?” Using Thomas Pynchon’s 1997 novel Mason & Dixon ( MD), about the drawing of the Mason-Dixon line, I explore how the mapmaker’s productive power is never merely reflective, but generative too, constructing a world as much as representing one. I question the consequent relation between “above and below,” drawing on Farinelli’s insight that critique of such constructions must recognize an antagonistic humor in the production of maps and territories. Pynchon’s novel, I argue, is exemplary in the wit with which it pits the anomalous, strange, and contingent phenomena of the below against the homogenizing, categorizing power of above.

While utopia for some critics constitutes a necessity and a persistent ideal, the chapter argues that, in the stories in question, the utopian vision is presented in a darker version that denies consummation of any utopia but instead turns it into a dystopia. The beach plays a significant role in this mutation as the beach is in constant relation to history, which becomes a central factor in the symbolic meaning of the beach. Despite the variations to this view, which arose in relation to the great wars when the beaches became a potential entry point for massive invasions, the beach has returned to an idea of positive connotations, and these are employed in the contemporary novels by Pynchon and McCarthy in order to activate our longing for a better world. Nevertheless, this longing is undermined, and utopia morphs into dystopia. The chapter argues that both novels show that it is possible to imagine utopian alternatives to the existing order and that the beach plays a vital role in the utopian outlay of the world even if it is unfolded in constant interaction with a neighborly dystopia.","2024","2024-06-28 22:01:15","2024-06-28 22:02:36","","","","","","","","","Routledge studies in comparative literature","","","","Routledge","New York, NY","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","PN56.B34 L58 2024","","","","","","Literary criticism; Beaches in literature; Essays","Meiner, Carsten; Andersen, Katrine Helene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Persistent questions concern modes of representing animals and animal-human hybrids, as well as the ethical issues raised by the human uses of other animals. From the animal men of Thomas Rowlandson to the part animal-part human creature of Victor Frankenstein, hybridity serves less as a metaphor than as a metonym for the intersections of humans and other animals. The contributors address such recurring questions as the implications of the Enlightenment project of naming and classifying animals, the equating of non-European races and nonhuman animals in early ethnographic texts, and the desire to distinguish the purely human from the entirely nonhuman animal. Gulliver's Travels and works by Mary and Percy Shelley emerge as key texts for this study. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students who work in animal, colonial, gender, and cultural studies; and will appeal to general readers concerned with the representation of animals and their treatment by humans","2020","2024-06-28 22:06:23","2024-07-07 23:49:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","London","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 1176298383","","","","","","Palmeri, Frank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primeiramente, explora-se a noção de intertextualidade conforme desenvolvida pelo círculo Tel Quel, para demonstrar que se trata de uma característica definidora da escrita pós-modernista de Pynchon. Em seguida, propõe-se uma leitura dos vários contextos e conotações que as Elegias de Duíno de Rilke evocam no texto de Pynchon. É meu propósito destacar a natureza multifacetada da paisagem intertextual patente na obra de Pynchon, assim como o seu uso complexo de referências, e as diferenças que existem entre essa paisagem e a da tradução húngara.","2023","2024-06-28 22:23:21","2024-06-28 22:23:21","2024-06-28 22:23:21","31-47","","4","","","JCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/D9ENZ3YU/Jenei - 2023 - The effects of translation a reading of Rilke-quot.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estas que foram dadas como de autoria do ficcionista estadunidense Thomas R. Pynchon; tese que foi desmentida por Donald Foster (2000) baseada em evidências históricas. Em 2018, escrevemos um primeiro ensaio fazendo a mesma contestação de Foster, mas baseado em dados referentes a escolhas lexicais de cada escritor. Ou seja: a refutação por meios linguísticos. Neste trabalho, nós enfrentamos o problema de novo para ratificar o resultado de Foster e o do nosso trabalho anterior, mas desta vez optamos por analisar valores como comprimento de períodos, frequência de sinais ortográficos e, especialmente, a riqueza lexical de cada corpus. Consideramos que o resultado confirmou nossa hipótese e, por fim, acreditamos, restar provado linguisticamente que Pynchon não escreveu as cartas de Wanda Tinasky.","2023-08-22","2024-07-07 00:55:00","2024-07-07 00:55:00","2024-07-07 00:55:00","5-26","","1","19","","TEXTO DIGITAL","Os porquês de Wanda Tinasky não ser Thomas Pynchon","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/erik/Zotero/storage/LLQFPMD3/Brandão - 2023 - Os porquês de Wanda Tinasky não ser Thomas Pynchon.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mason & Dixon, published a little before the turn of the millennium in 1997 and one of Pynchon's most critically-acclaimed works, has also provided fertile ground for twenty-first century criticism""","2019","2024-07-07 23:38:00","2024-07-07 23:45:28","","226-240","","","","","","","Twenty-first-century critical revisions","","","","Cambridge university press","Cambridge New York","eng","","","","","BnF ISBN","","","","","","","","Freer, Joanna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on specific concepts in urban and regional studies, the book provides a thorough examination of Pynchon’s spatial imaginary, where the reader comes to understand how his fiction tackles the socio-political and cultural consequences of urban restructuring in the contemporary city and the lives of its citizens. Pynchon’s depiction of California is further analyzed from mythical and environmental standpoints to shed light on his planetary vision and (post)postmodernist poetics in the span of nearly half a century. More broadly, the book’s geocritical and urban analyses of Pynchon’s fiction indicate what might take place concerning the future of urbanism, toward “planetary urbanization” and the formation of the “city region.”","2023","2024-07-14 01:47:44","2024-07-14 01:47:44","2024-07-14 01:47:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Publisher: Sapienza Università Editrice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mega-novel, a genre of erudite tomes with encyclopedic scope, has attracted wildly varied responses, from fanatical devotion to trenchant criticism. Looking at intimidating mega-novel masterpieces from The Making of Americans to 2666, David Letzler explores reader responses to all the seemingly random, irrelevant, pointless, and derailing elements that comprise these mega-novels, elements that he labels ""cruft"" after the computer science term for junk code. Letzler suggests that these books are useful tools to help us understand the relationship between reading and attention. While mega-novel text is often intricately meaningful or experimental, sometimes it is just excessive and pointless. On the other hand, mega-novels also contain text that, though appearing to be cruft, turns out to be quite important. Letzler posits that this cruft requires readers to develop a sophisticated method of attentional modulation, allowing one to subtly distinguish between text requiring focused attention and text that must be skimmed or even skipped to avoid processing failures. ""The Cruft of Fiction"" shows how the attentional maturation prompted by reading mega-novels can help manage the information overload that increasingly characterizes contemporary life","2017","2024-08-23 14:28:07","2024-08-23 14:28:07","","","","","","","","The cruft of fiction","Frontiers of narrative","","","","University of Nebraska press","Lincoln","eng","","","","","BnF ISBN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novel appears to subvert traditional definitions of plot and characterization, yet the narrative retains a nagging sense of order underneath the represented chaos. Simultaneously evoking and undoing patterns on all levels of its narrative structure, Gravity’s Rainbow surreptitiously evokes the presence of a night journey (Martindale, 1979). An empirical content analysis of the novel confirms this ambiguous attitude with respect to patterning in the novel, and thus constitutes a first and modest step towards the quantification of postmodernism. First, a thematic analysis, calculating the co-variations of words across the chapters, corroborates the idea of a connectedness that seems to belie, in part, the pervasive presence of a paranoid hermeneutic. Second, a dictionary-based analysis of narrative sequences reveals an inverse night journey pattern that differs markedly from other patterns found for modernist novels. The configurations that were obtained in these analyses show that content analysis can distinguish empirically between two literary - historical concepts.","2003-02","2024-10-30 01:49:25","2024-10-30 01:49:25","2024-10-30 01:49:25","27-41","","1","12","","Language and Literature: International Journal of Stylistics","Pynchon, postmodernism and quantification","","","","","","","en","https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
